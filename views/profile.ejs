      <p>
        "E-xchange" stands for electronic exchange, where used goods are sold and bought for money.
        The idea behind this project is to develop a institute / organisation level platform where people within that
        organisation can buy or sell goods or do both.<br>
        Here, E-xchange is developed to be used by students of NITW, where students can buy and sell goods like
        calculators, stationery, textbooks, cycles and many more.<br>
        Motto:
        With this website, one can:<br>
        1. Easily find customers for their belongings<br>
        2. Easily find their needs at better prices<br>
        3. Make money by selling reused things instead of keeping thrm idle<br>
        4. Reuse sustainable goods instead of wasting/misusing them<br>
